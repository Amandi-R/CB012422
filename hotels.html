                The distinctive Heritance Kandalama hotel, built into a cliff face amidst dense tropical trees and flanked by the Dambulla Rock Temple and Sigiriya Rock Fortress, was created by renowned Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa. The hotel's structures are covered in flowering plants and hanging vines in an effort to blend in with the surroundings.The Kandalama is a miracle of architecture and is located in the midst of Sri Lanka's cultural triangle. The eighth wonder of the world, Sigiriya, is visible from this hotel, which is carved into the mountainside in the shape of a bird with its wings spread.
